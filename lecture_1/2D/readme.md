Create generative patterns with this [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KMlVFi2zXhE0_PHCBXC07oblcJf9E13s). Then replace `data/models.json` with your new model, and try running the website to interact with your pattern.

## Usage

For running the website locally you can try `python -m http.server 8000` otherwise you can deploy it using platforms such as heroku and github pages.
